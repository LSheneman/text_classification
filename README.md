# Basic Text Classification with Naive BayesÂ¶

This project goes over the basics of text analysis using a subset of movie reviews from the rotten tomatoes database. You'll also use a fundamental technique in Bayesian inference, called Naive Bayes. This mini-project is based on Lab 10 of Harvard's CS109 class. Please free to go to the original lab for additional exercises and solutions.
